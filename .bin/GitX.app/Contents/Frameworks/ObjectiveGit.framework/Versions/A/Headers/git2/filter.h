 * write your own (see git2/sys/filter.h for information on that).
 *
 * The two builtin filters are:
 *
 * * "crlf" which uses the complex rules with the "text", "eol", and
 *   "crlf" file attributes to decide how to convert between LF and CRLF
 *   line endings
 * * "ident" which replaces "$Id$" in a blob with "$Id: <blob OID>$" upon
 *   checkout and replaced "$Id: <anything>$" with "$Id$" on checkin.
